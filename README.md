# VS Code - Automatically format code on save

Keep your code clean and tidy by automatically formatting edited file before saving it to the disk.

The extension adds a new command (`editor.action.formatAndSave`) to the command pallette and reassigns default key binding for saving (`Ctrl+S` / `⌘S`) to this new command. If you want to save a file without formatting, use a new key binding `Ctrl+Alt+S` / `⌥⌘S`.
